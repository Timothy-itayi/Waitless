This was the final project at Dev Academy for the students above. To show what we learned.

This is a full stack web app designed for restaurants. The idea is you put a qr code on each table, which the customers scan. This will take them to the menu where they can place an order which will be sent to the sqlite DB. The admin can then check orders, and add, modify, and delete items from the menu.
